    body1: 'Students and researchers learn to train AI models, but few understand how to build the systems that make them work in production. NEXUS exists to close that gap. We are a research-driven initiative dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence through the integration of algorithms, silicon systems, and real-world deployment.',
    body2: 'The institute serves as a convergence point for researchers, engineers, and innovators working at the intersection of AI accelerators, edge intelligence, efficient neural networks, and hardware\u2013software co-design. Our approach is systematic: we develop the ability to reason about ML architecture holistically, not component by component.',
